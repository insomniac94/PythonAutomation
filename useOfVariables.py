you can change the value of a variable by setting to equal 
to a new value

Here are the 4 basic rules for variable naming conventions:
  1.) It can only be one word
  2.) It can use only letters, numbers, and the '_' character
  3.) It can't begin with a number
  4.) It can't contain a hypen character '-'
